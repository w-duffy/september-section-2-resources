# Submitting the Project

After working through the scorecard, completing the [Before Submitting](BeforeSubmitting.md) guide, and checking all inputs in your application, you're ready to submit your team's project for grading.

## How to Submit the Project
Each team should update their scorecard and DM me confirming that you've:
1. Completed the "Before Submitting" checklist.
2. Checked every input in your app, ensuring that every input has appropriate validations.
3. Ensured I have editor access to your scorecard.
4. **Include a Link to your Scorecard in the DM**; this is what I will use to grade your team's project.

Once your project has been submitted, I will review it and enter grades on Monday.

## After Submitting

**After submitting your project**, please work on the Mod 6 portion of your job search materials.
