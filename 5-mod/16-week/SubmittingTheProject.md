# Submitting the Project

After working through the scorecard, completing the [Before Submitting](BeforeSubmitting.md) guide, and checking all inputs in your application, you're ready to submit your project for grading.

## How to Submit the Project
Update your scorecard and DM me confirming that you've:
1. Completed the "Before Submitting" checklist.
2. Checked every input in your app, ensuring that every input has appropriate validations.
3. **Provided** a Link to your Scorecard; please ensure I have editor access to your scorecard.

Once your project has been submitted, I will review it and enter grades **next** Tuesday.

## After Submitting

**After submitting your project**, please work on the Mod 5 portion of your job search materials.
